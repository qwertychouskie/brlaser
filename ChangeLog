    New printer entries:
        Brother FAX-2820
        Brother DCP-1610W

    Code Changes:
        Added \033&l1S for duplex no tumble printing, as well as logic print
          duplex with and without tumble.
        Explicitly include cstdint in test/tempfile.h, so uint8_t is correctly defined.

    Issues Resolved:
        Fixed building under Fedora 38; error: 'uint8_t' was not declared in this scope.
